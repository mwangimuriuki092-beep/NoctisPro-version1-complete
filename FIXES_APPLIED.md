## 📋 Summary of Fixes

- Added `flipImage(direction)` for horizontal/vertical flipping
- Added `handleToolClick(toolName)` for tool activation
- Added viewport flip properties (`flipH`, `flipV`)
- Added `activeTool` state tracking

**Location:** `static/js/dicom-viewer-professional.js`

**Impact:** 
- ✅ All viewport manipulation tools now work

- `'Bone'` → 3000/500 (CT bone window)
- `'Soft Tissue'` → 600/60 (CT soft tissue)
- `'Brain'` → 120/60 (CT brain window)
- `'Liver'` → 200/50 (CT liver window)
- `'Chest X-ray'` → 3500/800 (chest radiography)
- `'Bone X-ray'` → 5000/2500 (bone radiography)
- `'Extremity'` → 4500/2000 (extremity imaging)
- `'Spine'` → 4000/1500 (spine imaging)
- `'Abdomen'` → 2500/400 (abdominal imaging)

Also added alternate spellings:
- `'Chest Xray'`, `'chest xray'` variants
- `'Bone Xray'`, `'bone xray'` variants

**Location:** `static/js/dicom-viewer-professional.js`

**Impact:**
- ✅ Multiple API entry points for image operations
- ✅ Better backward compatibility
- ✅ Clearer function naming

---

### 6. Template Availability ✅

**Issue:** `worklist/worklist.html` template was missing (app uses dashboard.html instead).

**Fixed:**
- Created `templates/worklist/worklist.html` compatibility template
- Template provides navigation to:
  - Dashboard view
  - Study list view
  - Upload functionality
- Includes auto-redirect option to dashboard
- Modern, responsive design matching system aesthetics

**Location:** `templates/worklist/worklist.html`
