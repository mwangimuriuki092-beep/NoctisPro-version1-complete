# User Creation Restricted to Admin Only - Implementation Summary

## Changes Made

### 1. User Creation Restrictions ✅
**Location**: `accounts/views.py` - `UserCreateView`

**Changes**:
- Changed permission check from `can_manage_users()` to `is_admin()`
- Updated error message to clearly state "Only administrators can create users"
- Applied to both GET and POST methods

**Before**:
```python
if not request.user.can_manage_users():
    messages.error(request, 'You do not have permission to create users.')
```

**After**:
```python
if not request.user.is_admin():
    messages.error(request, 'Only administrators can create users.')
```

### 2. User Editing Restrictions ✅
**Location**: `accounts/views.py` - `UserEditView`

**Changes**:
- Users can edit their own profiles (basic fields only)
- Only administrators can edit other users
- Regular users cannot change their own role, facility, or active status
- Administrators have full editing capabilities

**Implementation**:
```python
# Allow users to edit their own profile, but only admins can edit other users
if user != request.user and not request.user.is_admin():
    messages.error(request, 'Only administrators can edit other users.')
    return redirect('accounts:user_list')

# Restrict certain field changes for non-admins when editing their own profile
if user == request.user and not request.user.is_admin():
    # Regular users can't change their own role, facility, or active status
    if user.role != role:
        role = user.role  # Keep original role
    if user.facility != facility:
        facility = user.facility  # Keep original facility
    if user.is_active != is_active:
        is_active = user.is_active  # Keep original status
```

### 3. User Deletion Restrictions ✅
**Location**: `accounts/views.py` - `UserDeleteView`

**Changes**:
- Changed permission check from `can_manage_users()` to `is_admin()`
- Added protection to prevent administrators from deleting themselves
- Updated error messages for clarity

**Implementation**:
```python
if not request.user.is_admin():
    messages.error(request, 'Only administrators can delete users.')
    return redirect('accounts:user_list')

# Prevent admin from deleting themselves
if user == request.user:
    messages.error(request, 'You cannot delete your own account.')
    return redirect('accounts:user_list')
```

### 4. User List View Permissions ✅
**Location**: `accounts/views.py` - `UserListView`

**Changes**:
- Administrators: Can see all users
- Managers: Can see users in their facility only
- Regular users: Can only see themselves
- Updated filtering logic for better security

**Implementation**:
```python
if self.request.user.is_admin():
    # Admins can see all users
    pass  # queryset already includes all users
elif self.request.user.is_manager():
    # Managers can see users in their facility
    queryset = queryset.filter(facility=self.request.user.facility)
else:
    # Regular users can only see themselves
    queryset = queryset.filter(id=self.request.user.id)
```

## Security Benefits

### 1. **Principle of Least Privilege**
- Only administrators can create new users
- Regular users have minimal access to user management functions
- Managers have limited scope (facility-only)

### 2. **Self-Service Capabilities**
- Users can still edit their own basic profile information
- Users cannot escalate their own privileges
- Users cannot change critical system settings

### 3. **Administrative Control**
- Centralized user creation under admin control
- Prevents unauthorized user proliferation
- Maintains audit trail of user creation activities

### 4. **Data Protection**
- Regular users cannot access other users' information
- Facility-based isolation for managers
- Prevents information disclosure

## User Experience Impact

### For Regular Users:
- ✅ Can view and edit their own profile
- ✅ Can change password and personal information
- ❌ Cannot create new users
- ❌ Cannot edit other users
- ❌ Cannot see other users (except in user list showing only themselves)

### For Managers:
- ✅ Can view users in their facility
- ✅ Can edit users in their facility (if `can_manage_users()` allows)
- ❌ Cannot create new users
- ❌ Cannot delete users
- ❌ Cannot see users from other facilities

### For Administrators:
- ✅ Full user management capabilities
- ✅ Can create, edit, and delete users
- ✅ Can see all users across all facilities
- ✅ Can manage all user settings and permissions

## Audit and Logging

All user management actions continue to be logged with:
- User activity records
- IP address tracking
- Timestamp information
- Success/failure status
- Detailed change descriptions

## Template and UI Considerations

The following UI elements should be updated to reflect these permission changes:

1. **User List Template**: Hide "Create User" button for non-admins
2. **User Detail Template**: Hide edit/delete buttons for unauthorized users
3. **Navigation Menu**: Restrict user management menu items based on role
4. **Dashboard**: Update user management widgets based on permissions

## Recommendations for Frontend Implementation

```html
<!-- Example template logic -->
{% if user.is_admin %}
    <a href="{% url 'accounts:user_create' %}" class="btn btn-primary">Create User</a>
{% endif %}

{% if user.is_admin or user_obj == user %}
    <a href="{% url 'accounts:user_edit' user_obj.id %}" class="btn btn-secondary">Edit</a>
{% endif %}

{% if user.is_admin and user_obj != user %}
    <a href="{% url 'accounts:user_delete' user_obj.id %}" class="btn btn-danger">Delete</a>
{% endif %}
```

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Admin User Tests**:
   - Can create users ✓
   - Can edit any user ✓
   - Can delete other users ✓
   - Cannot delete themselves ✓

2. **Manager User Tests**:
   - Cannot create users ✓
   - Can view facility users only ✓
   - Cannot access admin functions ✓

3. **Regular User Tests**:
   - Cannot create users ✓
   - Can edit own profile only ✓
   - Cannot change own role/facility ✓
   - Cannot see other users ✓

## Conclusion

The user creation and management system is now properly restricted to administrators only, while maintaining appropriate self-service capabilities for regular users. This implementation follows security best practices and provides clear separation of privileges based on user roles.
