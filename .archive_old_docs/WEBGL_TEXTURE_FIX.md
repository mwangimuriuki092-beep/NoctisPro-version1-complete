# WebGL Texture Binding Error - FIXED

## Problem Summary
The DICOM viewer was failing to display images with the error:
```
TypeError: WebGL2RenderingContext.bindTexture: Argument 2 does not implement interface WebGLTexture.
```

## Root Causes Identified

### 1. **Primary Issue: Context Mismatch in Fallback Rendering**
When WebGL rendering failed and tried to fall back to 2D rendering, the `render2D` function was using `this.context`, which was still pointing to the WebGL context instead of a 2D context. This caused the 2D rendering to fail completely.

**Solution:**
- Added a separate `context2d` property to store the 2D rendering context
- When WebGL is enabled, create a hidden 2D canvas for fallback rendering
- Modified `render2D` to use `this.context2d` instead of `this.context`
- After 2D fallback rendering, copy the result to the main canvas

### 2. **Secondary Issue: Insufficient Error Handling in WebGL Texture Creation**
The `createTexture` function could return `null` or an invalid texture, but the calling code would still try to bind it, causing the error.

**Solution:**
- Added comprehensive logging to track texture creation process
- Added validation before binding textures
- Added timeout handling for image loading (10 second timeout)
- Improved fallback texture creation when image loading fails
- Added better error messages to identify the exact failure point

### 3. **Tertiary Issue: References API Response Format**
The references API was returning an object, but the code expected an array, causing `references.map is not a function` error.

**Solution:**
- Modified `fetchReferences` to handle both array and object response formats
- Extract the references array from response data regardless of format

## Changes Made

### `/workspace/static/js/dicom-viewer-professional.js`

1. **Added `context2d` property to `DicomRenderer` class:**
   ```javascript
   constructor() {
       this.canvas = null;
       this.context = null;
       this.context2d = null;  // NEW
       this.webglSupported = false;
   }
   ```

2. **Modified `init()` to create separate 2D context:**
   - When WebGL is supported, create a hidden 2D canvas for fallback
   - Store both WebGL context in `this.context` and 2D context in `this.context2d`

3. **Enhanced `renderWebGL()` with better validation:**
   - Added double-check for texture validity before binding
   - Added better error logging
   - Improved cleanup on error

4. **Enhanced `createTexture()` with comprehensive error handling:**
   - Added detailed logging at each step
   - Added 10-second timeout for image loading
   - Improved fallback texture creation
   - Better cleanup on failure

5. **Modified `render2D()` to use correct context:**
   - Changed to use `this.context2d` instead of `this.context`
   - Added copy to main canvas when using fallback canvas
   - Added validation for context availability

6. **Updated `handleResize()` to resize fallback canvas:**
   - Also resizes the 2D fallback canvas when it exists
   - Ensures both canvases stay in sync during window resizing

### `/workspace/templates/dicom_viewer/masterpiece_viewer.html`

1. **Fixed `fetchReferences()` to handle different response formats:**
   ```javascript
   const references = Array.isArray(data) ? data : (data.references || []);
   displayReferences(references);
   ```

## Expected Behavior After Fix

1. **WebGL Rendering (Primary Path):**
   - Images load via WebGL for optimal performance
   - Proper error handling if texture creation fails
   - Detailed logging for debugging

2. **2D Fallback (When WebGL Fails):**
   - Automatically falls back to 2D rendering
   - Uses separate 2D canvas to avoid context conflicts
   - Copies result to main canvas for display
   - User sees the image regardless of WebGL support

3. **References Panel:**
   - Works with both array and object API responses
   - No more `references.map is not a function` errors

## Testing Recommendations

1. Refresh the page and load a study
2. Check browser console for detailed logging:
   - Look for "ðŸ”§ createTexture called with imageData"
   - Look for "ðŸ“¥ Loading image for WebGL texture"
   - Look for "âœ… WebGL texture created successfully" or fallback messages
3. Verify image displays correctly
4. Check references panel loads without errors

## Performance Impact

- Minimal impact: The hidden 2D canvas is only used for fallback
- When WebGL works, performance is unchanged
- When WebGL fails, 2D fallback provides reliable rendering
- No performance degradation from the fixes
