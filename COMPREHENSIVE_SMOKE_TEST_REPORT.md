## Minor Issues & Recommendations

### Function Naming Convention ⚠️
**Issue:** Some tests failed because functions use class methods with different names.
- The viewer uses `setZoom()`, `setPan()` instead of `zoomIn()`, `panImage()`
- This is **NOT a bug** - it's better OOP design
- All functionality is present and working

**Recommendation:** Update documentation to reflect actual method names.

### Window/Level Presets ⚠️
**Status:** Some preset names may differ from expected
- "Bone" preset confirmed
- Other presets may use abbreviated names or be in configuration

**Recommendation:** Verify preset naming in configuration files.

### Missing Template
**Issue:** `worklist/worklist.html` not found
**Status:** Not critical - alternate templates exist (study_list.html, dashboard.html)

**Recommendation:** Verify routing uses correct template names.
