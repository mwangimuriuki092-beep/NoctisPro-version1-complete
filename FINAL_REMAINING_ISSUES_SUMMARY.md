## 🔧 **MINOR REMAINING ISSUES:**

### 1. **Template Files** ⚠️
**Issue**: Many HTML templates referenced by views don't exist yet
**Impact**: Views will show Django template errors but won't break the system
**Examples**:
- `templates/accounts/enable_2fa.html`
- `templates/accounts/password_reset_email.html`
- `templates/reports/create_report.html`
- `templates/ai_analysis/dashboard.html`
- `templates/notifications/center.html`

**Status**: Non-critical - can be created as needed for specific features

### 2. **Email Configuration** ⚠️
**Issue**: Password reset emails need SMTP configuration
**Impact**: Password reset will work but emails won't send without proper email settings
**Solution**: Configure `EMAIL_HOST`, `EMAIL_PORT`, etc. in settings

### 3. **Database Migrations** ⚠️
**Issue**: New `PasswordResetToken` model needs migration
**Impact**: Model won't be created in database until migration runs
**Solution**: Run `python manage.py makemigrations accounts && python manage.py migrate`

### 4. **Static Files** ⚠️
**Issue**: Some JavaScript TODO comments for advanced features
**Impact**: Basic functionality works, advanced features need implementation
**Examples**:
- 3D reconstruction features
- Advanced AI analysis display
- Complex DICOM manipulation

## 🚀 **SYSTEM STATUS:**

## 🎯 **RECOMMENDATIONS FOR NEXT STEPS:**

### **High Priority:**
1. **Run Database Migrations**
   ```bash
   python manage.py makemigrations accounts
   python manage.py migrate
   ```

2. **Configure Email Settings** (for password reset)
   ```python
   EMAIL_HOST = 'smtp.gmail.com'
   EMAIL_PORT = 587
   EMAIL_USE_TLS = True
   EMAIL_HOST_USER = 'your-email@gmail.com'
   EMAIL_HOST_PASSWORD = 'your-app-password'
   ```

### **Medium Priority:**
3. **Create Key Templates** (as needed for specific features)
   - User management templates
   - Report creation/editing templates
   - AI analysis dashboard templates

### **Low Priority:**
4. **Implement Advanced Features** (optional)
   - 3D DICOM reconstruction
   - Advanced AI analysis displays
   - Complex reporting features
