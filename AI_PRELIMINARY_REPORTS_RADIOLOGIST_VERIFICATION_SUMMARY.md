# AI Preliminary Reports & Radiologist Verification System

## Overview

The NoctisPro PACS system implements a comprehensive AI-assisted reporting workflow where:

1. **AI generates preliminary reports** from DICOM analysis
2. **Radiologists review and verify** these AI-generated reports
3. **Final reports are signed** with the radiologist's name who verified them
4. **Proper role-based permissions** ensure only qualified personnel can edit/verify reports

## System Architecture

### 1. AI Preliminary Report Generation

**Models Involved:**
- `AIAnalysis` - Stores AI analysis results
- `AutoGeneratedReport` - AI-generated preliminary reports awaiting review
- `AutoReportTemplate` - Templates for different study types

**Process:**
1. AI analyzes DICOM images and generates findings
2. System creates an `AutoGeneratedReport` with:
   - Generated findings, impression, and recommendations
   - Confidence scores and quality metrics
   - Status: `pending` (awaiting radiologist review)

### 2. Radiologist Verification Workflow

**Report States:**
- `draft` - Initial report creation
- `preliminary` - AI-generated, awaiting verification
- `final` - Verified and signed by radiologist
- `amended` - Modified after initial finalization
- `cancelled` - Cancelled report

**Verification Process:**
1. Radiologist reviews AI preliminary report
2. Can **Approve**, **Modify**, or **Reject** the AI findings
3. Upon approval/modification, report moves to `final` status
4. Radiologist's name is attached as the verifying physician

## Role-Based Permissions Implementation

## AI-to-Radiologist Workflow

### Step 1: AI Analysis
```
Study ‚Üí AI Analysis ‚Üí Preliminary Findings ‚Üí AutoGeneratedReport
```

### Step 2: Radiologist Review
```
AutoGeneratedReport ‚Üí Radiologist Review ‚Üí Decision:
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Approve ‚Üí Final Report (Radiologist Name)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Modify ‚Üí Edit ‚Üí Final Report (Radiologist Name)  
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Reject ‚Üí New Analysis Required
```

### Step 3: Final Report
```
Final Report includes:
- AI-generated content (if approved/modified)
- Radiologist verification
- Digital signature
- Timestamp of verification
- Radiologist's name and credentials
```

## Permission Checks in Code

### Report Views (reports/views.py):
```python
# Only radiologists and admins can create reports
if not (request.user.is_radiologist() or request.user.is_admin()):
    messages.error(request, 'Only radiologists and administrators can create reports.')
    return redirect('worklist:study_detail', study_id=study_id)

# Only radiologists and admins can sign reports  
if not (request.user.is_radiologist() or request.user.is_admin()):
    messages.error(request, 'Only radiologists and administrators can sign reports.')
    return redirect('reports:report_detail', report_id=report_id)
```

### AI Analysis Views (ai_analysis/views.py):
```python
# Existing helper function for AI permissions
def is_admin_or_radiologist(user):
    return user.is_authenticated and (user.is_admin() or user.is_radiologist())

@user_passes_test(is_admin_or_radiologist)
def generate_auto_report(request, study_id):
    # Only radiologists and admins can generate AI reports
```

## User Experience by Role

### **Radiologists:**
- ‚úÖ Receive AI preliminary reports for review
- ‚úÖ Can approve AI findings with their verification
- ‚úÖ Can modify AI content before approval
- ‚úÖ Can reject AI reports and request new analysis
- ‚úÖ Final reports show their name as verifying physician
- ‚úÖ Can create manual reports when AI is not suitable

### **Administrators:**
- ‚úÖ Full access to all radiologist functions
- ‚úÖ Can manage AI models and system configuration
- ‚úÖ Can delete reports if necessary
- ‚úÖ Can oversee the entire AI-to-radiologist workflow

### **Technologists:**
